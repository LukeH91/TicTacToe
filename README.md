# TicTacToe 1.3
My first ever project in Python - a Tic-Tac-Toe game. 

1.0 - First completed version

1.1 - Fixed a bug where the board did not reset upon choosing to play another game. Added a draw state, so the game ends if the board fills.

1.2 - Fixed a bug where the board would print more than once if the player selected an occupied slot.

1.3 - Fixed a bug where a player winning while filling the board would be counted as a draw instead of a win.
